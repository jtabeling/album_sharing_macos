# Progress

**Current Status:** Project complete with modifications to adapt to system constraints.

**What Works:**
*   Project plan executed and adapted based on discovered constraints.
*   `Info.plist` created with required permissions.
*   `AlbumSharerViewModel` created and fully implemented:
    *   Handles Photo Library authorization.
    *   Fetches user albums (all types for wider compatibility).
    *   Checks for existing iCloud Shared Album conflicts.
    *   Creates a new regular album.
    *   Copies assets from source to new album in batches, showing progress.
    *   Provides status updates and error messages.
    *   Includes verbose logging.
*   `ContentView` created and fully implemented:
    *   Displays album list and allows selection.
    *   Shows status messages.
    *   Includes a button to trigger the copy process.
    *   Displays a progress bar during processing.
*   Album duplication works correctly:
    *   Creates a regular album with the same name as the source.
    *   Copies all photos/videos from source to the new album.
    *   Shows progress and completion status.
    
**What's Left to Build:**
*   None for core album copying functionality.
*   Original plan to link to sharing functionality was abandoned due to system constraints.

**Known Issues/Constraints:**
*   Original goal to create iCloud Shared Albums directly is not possible through the Photos framework API.
*   Attempted workaround using instructions for manual sharing wasn't viable on the user's system.
*   The app now focuses solely on the album duplication functionality without sharing instructions.
